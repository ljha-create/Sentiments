Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning. It demonstrates how to classify text data (such as reviews, tweets, or comments) into positive or negative sentiment categories.

The notebook walks through essential steps of preprocessing text, applying feature extraction, training models, and evaluating the performance. It serves as a starting point for anyone new to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text classification.

Features
Preprocessing text data (tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal)

Converting text to numerical features using TF-IDF/Bag-of-Words

Training basic ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or similar)

Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Interactive Jupyter Notebook to understand step-by-step workflow

Tech Stack
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

NLTK / Text Processing Tools

Pandas & NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/ljha-create/Sentiments.git
cd Sentiments
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is missing, you can manually install major dependencies like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn.)

Open the notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook SentimentAnal.ipynb
Usage
Run all cells in SentimentAnal.ipynb sequentially.

You can replace the dataset with your own text data for experiments.

Modify preprocessing or model training sections to try out different techniques.

Results
Achieves basic classification of text into positive and negative sentiment.

Helps beginners understand the basics of NLP pipelines.

Can be extended with advanced techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT).

Future Improvements
Add more datasets for robust testing

Implement deep learning models (e.g., RNN, LSTMs, Transformers)

Enhance visualization of sentiment distribution

Deploy as a simple web app using Flask/Streamlit
